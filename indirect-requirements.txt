# Requirements which are indirectly needed for various reasons.
# That is, they are not imported by our code.
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# At the time of writing, with the latest versions of the DC/OS E2E direct
# dependencies, there is a version conflict for ``msrestazure``, an
# indirect dependency.
# Therefore, we pin a particular version which satisfies all requirements.
# See DCOS-40131.
msrestazure==0.4.34
# ``keyring`` is a requirement of ``msrestazure``.
# We make sure that we get a version of keyring which is compatible with the
# pinned version of SecretStorage on Python 3.5+ (compatibility is different
# on different Python versions).
keyring==16.0.2
# Without the following, some users get:
# The 'secretstorage' distribution was not found and is required by keyring
SecretStorage==3.1.0
# Requirements from DC/OS Launch
azure-mgmt-network==2.2.1
azure-mgmt-resource==2.0.0
# Pin requirement for ``msrest`` to avoid
# https://github.com/Azure/msrest-for-python/issues/128
# which interferes with documentation building, at least.
msrest==0.4.29
