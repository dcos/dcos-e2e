# Unfortunately Travis has a time out for total test run (50 minutes) and total time without
# output (10 minutes).
#
# We avoid the former by running only a small part of our test suite.
#
# We get around the latter by using `travis_wait` which hides all output
# until the tests are finished.
#
# We do not run tests in parallel as this uses too much space for Travis CI.
# The main use of space is the copying of the config file to each directory.
