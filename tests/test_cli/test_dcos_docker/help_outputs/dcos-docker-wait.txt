Usage: minidcos docker wait [OPTIONS]

  Wait for DC/OS to start.

Options:
  -c, --cluster-id TEXT           The ID of the cluster to use.  [default:
                                  default]
  --superuser-username TEXT       The superuser username is needed only on DC/OS
                                  Enterprise clusters.   [default:
                                  bootstrapuser]
  --superuser-password TEXT       The superuser password is needed only on DC/OS
                                  Enterprise clusters.   [default: deleteme]
  --skip-http-checks              Do not wait for checks which require an HTTP
                                  connection to the cluster. If this flag is
                                  used, this command may return before DC/OS is
                                  fully ready. Use this flag in cases where an
                                  HTTP connection cannot be made to the cluster.
                                  For example this is useful on macOS without a
                                  VPN set up.  [default: False]
  --transport [docker-exec|ssh]   The communication transport to use. On macOS
                                  the SSH transport requires IP routing to be
                                  set up. See "minidcos docker setup-mac-
                                  network". It also requires the "ssh" command
                                  to be available. This can be provided by
                                  setting the `MINIDCOS_DOCKER_TRANSPORT`
                                  environment variable. When using a TTY,
                                  different transports may use different line
                                  endings.  [default: docker-exec]
  -v, --verbose                   Use verbose output. Use this option multiple
                                  times for more verbose output.
  --enable-spinner / --no-enable-spinner
                                  Whether to show a spinner animation. This
                                  defaults to true if stdout is a TTY.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
