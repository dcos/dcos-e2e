Usage: minidcos vagrant install [OPTIONS] INSTALLER

  Install DC/OS on a provisioned Vagrant cluster.

Options:
  --extra-config FILE             The path to a file including DC/OS
                                  configuration YAML. The contents of this file
                                  will be added to add to a default
                                  configuration.
  --workspace-dir DIRECTORY       Creating a cluster can use approximately 2 GB
                                  of temporary storage. Set this option to use a
                                  custom "workspace" for this temporary storage.
                                  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile
                                  .html#tempfile.gettempdir for details on the
                                  temporary directory location if this option is
                                  not set.
  --variant [auto|oss|enterprise]
                                  Choose the DC/OS variant. If the variant does
                                  not match the variant of the given installer,
                                  an error will occur. Using "auto" finds the
                                  variant from the installer. Finding the
                                  variant from the installer takes some time and
                                  so using another option is a performance
                                  optimization.
  --license-key FILE              This is ignored if using open source DC/OS. If
                                  using DC/OS Enterprise, this defaults to the
                                  value of the `DCOS_LICENSE_KEY_PATH`
                                  environment variable.
  --genconf-dir DIRECTORY         Path to a directory that contains additional
                                  files for the DC/OS installer. All files from
                                  this directory will be copied to the "genconf"
                                  directory before running the DC/OS installer.
  --security-mode [disabled|permissive|strict]
                                  The security mode to use for a DC/OS
                                  Enterprise cluster. This overrides any
                                  security mode set in ``--extra-config``.
  -c, --cluster-id TEXT           A unique identifier for the cluster. Use the
                                  value "default" to use this cluster for other
                                  commands without specifying --cluster-id.
  -v, --verbose                   Use verbose output. Use this option multiple
                                  times for more verbose output.
  --enable-spinner / --no-enable-spinner
                                  Whether to show a spinner animation. This
                                  defaults to true if stdout is a TTY.
  --wait-for-dcos                 Wait for DC/OS after creating the cluster.
                                  This is equivalent to using "minidcos vagrant
                                  wait" after this command.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.
