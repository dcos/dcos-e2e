# Oinker Example

Oinker-Go is an HA Twitter clone that depends on Cassandra for storage and Marathon-LB for provide load balancing.

Cassandra and Marathon-LB can be installed from the Mesosphere Universe, but they need to be configured for minimal memory footprint in order to work on dcos-docker.

Use the following steps to install and access Oinker:

1. Setup

    See [Setup](/README.md#setup).

    **Linux:** Make sure your disk has at least 20GB free space for DC/OS Docker to use.

    **Vagrant:** Resize the VM disk size to at least 20GB.

    The default box image only has 10GB of disk space, which will almost completely fill up just by deploying DC/OS, not leaving any space for services. Resizing must be done from the host before deploying DC/OS.

    ```
    vagrant/resize-disk.sh 20480
    ```

1. Deploy DC/OS

   See [Deploy](/README.md#deploy).

   The default configuration of 1 master, 1 private agent, and 1 public agent should work as long as the host has enough memory and disk available. Vagrant VM memory is configurable in the Vagrantfile.

1. Setup routing

    **Linux:** No routing needed.

    **Vagrant:** See [Network Routing](/README.md#network-routing).

1. Install DC/OS CLI

   See DC/OS Web UI for instructions (bottom left corner).

1. Log in to DC/OS

   ```
   dcos auth login
   ```

   Follow the instructions (different for DC/OS vs Enterprise DC/OS).

1. Install Cassandra

    ```
    dcos package install --options=examples/oinker/pkg-cassandra.json cassandra --yes
    ```

    This minimal config only runs a single Cassandra node, unlike the default config that runs three.

    Cassandra takes a minute to deploy the scheduler and node-0 on private agents. Wait for both be running.

1. Install Marathon-LB

    ```
    dcos package install --options=examples/oinker/pkg-marathon-lb.json marathon-lb --yes
    ```

    Marathon-LB will start one task on the public agent. Wait for it to be running (should be quick).

1. Install Oinker

    ```
    dcos marathon app add examples/oinker/oinker.json
    ```

    If Cassandra isn't completely ready before starting Oinker, Oinker may thrash and restart a few times before becoming healthy.

1. Find the IP of the public agent

    **Linux:**
    ```
    PUBLIC_IP="$(docker inspect --format "{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}" dcos-docker-pubagent1)"
    ```

    **Vagrant:**
    ```
    PUBLIC_IP="$(vagrant ssh -c "docker inspect --format "{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}" dcos-docker-pubagent1" | tr -d "\015")"
    ```

1. Add oinker.acme.org to /etc/hosts

    ```
    echo "${PUBLIC_IP}"$'\toinker.acme.org' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

1. (Mac-only) Refresh the hostname resolver

    ```
    sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
    ```

1. Visit <http://oinker.acme.org> in a browser!
