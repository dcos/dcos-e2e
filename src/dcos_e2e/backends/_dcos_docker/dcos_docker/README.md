# DC/OS Docker

Run DC/OS in Docker containers!

Each container on the host emulates a DC/OS node, using Docker-in-Docker to run DC/OS jobs & services.

DC/OS Docker is designed to optimize development cycle time. For a more production-like local experience, see [DC/OS Vagrant](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant) which runs each node in its own VM.

## Issue Tracking

- Issue tracking is in [DCOS JIRA](https://jira.mesosphere.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DCOS_OSS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20dcos-docker%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Open%20).
- Remember to make a DC/OS JIRA account and login so you can get update notifications!

## Caveats

- Because of Docker-in-Docker, DC/OS services (like Jenkins) that themselves use Docker-in-Docker may not work correctly.
- Because containerization does not affect resource detection tools, each DC/OS node will think it can allocate all of the host's resources, leading to over-subscription without protection. You are still bound by the disk and memory constraints of the host, even if DC/OS thinks you have N (number of agent nodes) times more. Running Docker in a VM can protect your host from this and allows you to designate how much disk/memory/cpu DC/OS gets in total. Running Docker directly on a Linux host gives DC/OS more resources to play with but may also freeze your machine if you run too many DC/OS services/jobs.

## Requirements

DC/OS Docker can be run on Linux, macOS, or on Linux in a VM using Vagrant with VirtualBox.
The support for macOS as a host is experimental.

Host Docker storage drivers of `overlay` and `aufs` are supported automatically. For anything else, see [Storage Driver](#storage-driver) for config instructions.

### Linux

- systemd (recommended) or [no systemd](#non-systemd-host) (experiemental)
- A recent kernel that supports Overlay FS
- Docker 1.13.1+
- make
- git

### Mac

> **NOTE:**  Docker for Mac support is experimental. Use Vagrant for a better tested configuration.

- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) 1.13.1+
  - 6GB Memory (recommended). See [Docker for Mac advanced config](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced) for more details.
- make
- git

### Vagrant

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 5.1.18+
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 1.9.3+
- git

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/dcos/dcos-docker
    cd dcos-docker
    ```

1. Download [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/releases/) or [Enterprise DC/OS](https://mesosphere.com/product/) into the root of the dcos-docker repo directory.

    For example, download the latest stable release:

    ```console
    make installer
    ```

1. (**Mac-only**) Modify the DC/OS installer to support BSD sed:

    ```console
    sed -i="" -E -e 'H;1h;$!d;x' -e "s/sed '0,/sed '1,/" dcos_generate_config.sh
    ```

    See [Mac Compatible installers](#mac-compatible-installers) for more details.

1. (**Vagrant-only**) Bring up the Virtual Machine with a chosen disk size.

    Vagrant disks are sparse and as such they will only use the space that is actually used.

    DC/OS should deploy with a size of 100GB, but for larger deployments you may need to increase the size of the VM.

    The first argument is the desired disk size in MB (ex: 102400 is 100GB).

    ```console
    vagrant/resize-disk.sh 102400
    ```

1. (**Vagrant-only**) SSH into the virtual machine:

    ```console
    vagrant ssh
    ```

## Deploy

1. Deploy DC/OS in Docker:

    ```console
    make
    ```

1. (Optional) Wait for DC/OS to come up:

    ```console
    make postflight
    ```

For other make commands, see `make help`.

## Network Routing

By default with Vagrant or Docker for Mac, containers are not reachable from the host.
This will prohibit SSHing into a container (not `docker exec`) and viewing the DC/OS GUI in a browser.
However, there are a few workarounds described below.

### Vagrant

To make the Docker containers in the VM reachable from the host, you can route Docker's IP subnet (`172.17.0.0/16`) through the VM's IP (`192.168.65.50`). This routing is not required if you deployed DC/OS to Docker on a native Linux host.

Execute the following on the host machine. Once routing is set up, you can access DC/OS directly from the host.

**Setup**

On Linux:
```console
$ sudo ip route replace 172.17.0.0/16 via 192.168.65.50
```

On macOS:
```console
$ sudo route -nv add -net 172.17.0.0/16 192.168.65.50
```

**Cleanup**

On Linux:
```console
$ sudo ip route del 172.17.0.0/16
```

On macOS:
```console
$ sudo route delete 172.17.0.0/16
```

### Docker for Mac

HyperKit (the hypervisor used by Docker for Mac) does not currently support IP routing on Mac.

Use one of the following alternative solutions instead:

- [docker-mac-network](https://github.com/wojas/docker-mac-network) sets up a VPN running in containers and uses a VPN client to route traffic to other containers.
- [Docker for Mac - Host Bridge](https://github.com/mal/docker-for-mac-host-bridge) uses a kernel extension to add a new network interface and Docker network bridge.

### Node Shell Access

With network routing configured, you can SSH directly into DC/OS nodes from the host:

```console
host$ ssh -i genconf/ssh_key root@172.17.0.2
```

Or you can SSH with the DC/OS CLI:

```console
$ dcos node ssh --leader --user=root --option IdentityFile=genconf/ssh_key
```

From the host (or SSH'd into Vagrant) you can also use Docker exec to open a shell:

```console
$ docker ps --format="table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
CONTAINER ID        NAMES                   STATUS
7498dcbe4e3e        dcos-docker-pubagent1   Up About a minute
b66175f0a18a        dcos-docker-agent1      Up About a minute
e80466ce71c9        dcos-docker-master1     Up About a minute

$ docker exec -it dcos-docker-master1 bash
```

## Storage Driver

By default, the docker daemon in the DC/OS node containers is configured to use
the same storage driver as the host docker daemon, but this method is only verified
to work for `aufs` and `overlay`. Other storage drivers may work, but are not tested.
They can be configured manually by setting the `DOCKER_STORAGEDRIVER` make variable.

To check the current host storage driver, use `docker info --format "{{json .Driver}}"`.

### Loopback

The loopback `devicemapper` storage driver may cause loopback devices to not be
properly cleaned up and thus prevent the docker daemon from starting. YMMV though.

### Overlay2

Newer versions of docker (17+) default to the `overlay2` storage driver. Since `overlay2`
is not supported by Docker 1.11.2 (the default version in the "node" containers), you must
also specify a newer version of Docker to use in the "node" containers:

```
make DOCKER_STORAGEDRIVER=overlay2 DOCKER=1.13.1
```

Alternatively, Docker itself can be configured to use `overlay`.

To configure Docker for Mac, go to `Docker > Preferences > Daemon Advanced`, add
`"storage-driver" : "overlay"` to the configuration file, and click `Apply & Restart`.

To configure other versions of Docker, see the Docker docs appropriate to your version.

## Settings

### Changing the number of masters or agents

This defaults to 1 master and 1 agent. You can change the number of masters by
setting the variable `MASTERS`. You can change the number of agents by setting
the variable `AGENTS`. For example:

```console
# start a cluster with 3 masters and 5 agents
$ make MASTERS=3 AGENTS=5
```

### Changing the distro

> **NOTE:** This feature should only be used for testing, it is unstable.

By default the cluster will be spun up using a centos base image but if you
want to test something else you can run:

```console
$ make DISTRO=fedora
```

### Non-systemd host

By default, systemd is used on the host to create a [systemd
slice](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html).
This is the supported configuration.

It is possible to run DC/OS Docker on hosts without systemd.  Set the variable
`MESOS_SYSTEMD_ENABLE_SUPPORT` to `false` to disable systemd on the host. This
changes a Mesos setting. Although this setting works at the time of writing, it is not officially supported by DC/OS and so this feature is experimental.

One problem which may occur when not using `systemd` on the host is that executors and tasks will be killed when the agent is restarted. [A JIRA issue](https://jira.mesosphere.com/browse/DCOS_OSS-1131) tracks making it possible to run DC/OS Docker in a supported manner without `systemd`.


### Docker version

By default the "node" containers will include Docker 1.11.2.
Docker 1.13.1 is also supported, but must be configured:

```console
$ make DOCKER_VERSION=1.13.1
```

One reason to use Docker 1.13.1 might be to use the `overlay2` storage driver,
which is not supported by Docker 1.11.2.
See [Storage Driver](#storage-driver) for details.

## Troubleshooting

Oh dear, you must be in an unfortunate position. You have a few options with
regard to debugging your container cluster.

If the containers are currently running then the best option is to `docker exec`
into the master or agent and poke around. Here is an example of that:

```console
$ docker exec -it dcos-docker-master1 bash

# list the systemd units
[root@dcos-docker-master1 /]# systemctl list-units
...
dbus.socket                         loaded active     running         D-Bus System Message Bus Socket
systemd-fail.service                loaded failed     exited          Journal Audit Socket
systemd-journald-dev-log.socket     loaded active     running         Journal Socket (/dev/log)
systemd-journald.socket             loaded active     running         Journal Socket
basic.target                        loaded active     active          Basic System
dcos.target                         loaded active     active          dcos.target
local-fs.target                     loaded active     active          Local File Systems
...

# find the failed unit and get the status
[root@dcos-docker-master1 /]# systemctl status systemd-fail

# get the logs from journald
[root@dcos-docker-master1 /]# journalctl -xefu systemd-fail
```

For the `dcos-spartan` service to start successfully, make sure that
you have dummy net driver support (`CONFIG_DUMMY`) enabled in your kernel.
Most standard distribution kernels should have this by default. On some
older kernels you may need to manually install this module with
`modprobe dummy` before starting the container cluster.

## Docker out of space

```
docker volume prune
```

## Github Pull Request (PR) Labels

Various labels used on pull requests and what they mean

 - `Work in progress` The code is a work in progress / not yet ready to be
   reviewed or acted upon by others. It can be handy to open up a PR in order
   to share work / ideas with others. Use this label to indicate the PR isn't
   intended to be reviewed or merged.
 - `Request for comment` The code is some idea which may or may not land, but
    there are questions if the approach is right. Review should focus on
    whether or not it is overall a good idea to do this and how to structure it.
 - `Ready for review` The author thinks the PR is ready to land, and is looking for a
    review in order to get it in. The PR may bounce back to "work in progress"
    or "request for comment" if it needs more work or discussion. Might also
    just do all the review and fixup with the label attached.

## Mac Compatible Installers

DC/OS installers are not immediately compatible with the BSD sed that ships with macOS. This will be fixed in a future release of DC/OS: https://github.com/dcos/dcos/pull/1571 . For now, use one of the following options:

1. Modify the installer with the following script:

    ```
    sed -i="" -E -e 'H;1h;$!d;x' -e "s/sed '0,/sed '1,/" dcos_generate_config.sh
    ```

2. Install GNU sed with Homebrew:

    ```
    brew install gnu-sed --with-default-names
    ```

    Warning: This method will make GNU sed the default sed, which may have unforeseen side-effects.
